## friction_modelling_example
<p align = "justify"> An example of how Static and  Coulomb friction are taken into consideration by subtracting them from the plant during the integration stage. <br></p>
## switching_modification function 
<p align = justify> It is necessary to enrich the controllers with this robustness mechanism when using it to control the actual plant that includes unmodeled friction. <br> </p>
