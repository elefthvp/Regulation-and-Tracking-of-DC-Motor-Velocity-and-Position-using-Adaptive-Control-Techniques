## Controllers
<p align=justify> A wide variety of adaptive controllers and their correspondent known-parameter versions, Linear Feedback Controllers, and a Prescribed- Performance controller simulated using the ideal models and fine-tuned. <br> </p>
<p align = justify> The same controllers are tested using the system model for which they were created and taking into consideration Coulomb and static friction that act as disturbances. The contollers are enriched with robust mechanisms ensure overall stability and the control schemes are fine-tuned again to achieve minimum tracking and parameter estimation error. <br> </p>

## Implementation
<p align=justify> The contents of this directory are used to slightly modify the original controllers used for digital simulations in order to carry out experiments on the real-life plant <br> </p?

### ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I especially appreciate the guidance of professor George Rovitahkis who supervises this thesis. I express my admiration towards mr. Petros Ioannou and mr. Baris Fidan regarding their work on the "Adaptive Control Tutorial" book that I thoroughly studied to implement my control schemes.
