## Controllers
<p align="justify" A wide variety of adaptive controllers and their correspondent known-parameter versions, Linear Feedback Controllers, and a Prescribed- Performance controller simulated using the ideal models and fine-tuned. <br> </p>
<p alaign = "justify" The same controllers are tested using the system model for which they were created and taking into consideration Coulomb and static friction that act as disturbances. The contollers are enriched with robust mechanisms ensure overall stability and the control schemes are fine-tuned again to achieve minimum tracking and parameter estimation error. <br> </p>

## Implementation
Combine the codes in this directory to carry out experiments on the real-life plant for which the controllers were made.
