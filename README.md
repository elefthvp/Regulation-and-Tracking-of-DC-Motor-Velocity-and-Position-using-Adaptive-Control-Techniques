## FUNCTION REPETITION
<p align=justify> The experiments are still ongoing and these folders are directly linked to my local repository, thus functions that might appear multiple times in different folders are either necessary for an easier program execution or share the same name and overall functionality but a different content, each time adjusted to the specific control scheme (i.e. all figures functions generate figures but the figures to be printed vary for every controller).  <br> </p>
<p align=justify> The overall organisation of the thesis repo will change after its completion and identical functions appearing in different places will be added to a unique directory mentioned in each controllers README Dependencies section.  <br> </p>
